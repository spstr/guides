## Variables

Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign ($) followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive.

 ```php
    //example
    
    $variable = "new string";
```

Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP. A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: '[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*'
